# Consolidation Notes

- Synthesized the three detailed agent reports by mapping their findings onto standardized quality dimensions without repetition.
- Prioritized Security/Governance concerns at the top due to coordination rules, ensuring all related issues and recommendations are captured fully.
- Integrated architectural and operational points with code quality insights to form coherent sections under each quality attribute.
- Resolved conflicts by deferring to industry standards and existing authoritative frameworks cited in validation sources.
- Removed trivial beginner advice and summarized recommendations into senior-level actionable guidance.
- Added a comprehensive validation sources table ordered by relevance and credibility to support the principles.
- Omitted overly granular implementation details that do not impact architectural or governance evaluation.
- Ensured technical precision and suitability for peer review in senior engineering contexts.

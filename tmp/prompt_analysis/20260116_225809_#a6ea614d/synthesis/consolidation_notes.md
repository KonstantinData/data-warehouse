# Consolidation Notes

- The three specialist agent outputs were complementary with no fundamental contradictions.
- Agent reports on code quality and architecture substantially overlapped; their concerns on `main()` modularity, path configuration, error handling, and observability were synthesized and prioritized.
- Security and governance concerns from the dedicated agent were merged and elevated in priority, especially on data privacy, secrets management, and logging security.
- Duplicate observations (e.g., missing value standardization duplication, SHA256 hash use) were consolidated into single findings with clear recommendations.
- Recommendations were categorized into code quality, architecture/operations, security/compliance, and documentation for clarity and actionable targeting.
- Risks were emphasized where multiple agents identified similar vulnerabilities.
- Validation sources were selected from authoritative, industry-standard texts and frameworks explicitly referenced or aligned with the principles observed.
- No invented sources or beginner-level opinions were added; all references are widely recognized in professional data engineering and software engineering domains.
- The final synthesis maps directly to the original deliverable scope, addressing production-grade Python ELT pipelines with robust governance and operational excellence focus.

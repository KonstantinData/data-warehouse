# Consolidation Notes

- Synthesized overlapping findings from all agents into succinct, non-redundant categories aligned with requested scope.
- Resolved potential conflicts by prioritizing security and governance issues first, followed by architecture/operations, then code quality.
- Incorporated security recommendations from the specialist security agent that were only implied or lightly touched upon by other agents.
- Augmented documentation and observability recommendations to cover gaps noted across sources.
- Omitted beginner-level advice; focused on actionable guidance suitable for senior engineering, architecture reviews, and audits.
- Compiled authoritative sources only based on recognized industry standards and frameworks explicitly mentioned or conventionally accepted.
- Ensured no invented sources or unverifiable claims are included.
- Final output is suitable for use in senior engineering reviews, ADRs, and team onboarding documentation.

# Consolidation Notes

- The three specialist agents provided largely complementary perspectives with overlapping observations on correctness, observability, maintainability, and security.
- Duplicated findings were synthesized and redundancies eliminated, ensuring precision and senior-level substance without verbatim repetition.
- In conflicts (e.g., on level of modularity), the architecture and maintainability best practices from Google SRE, Clean Code, and Microsoft/Databricks Data Engineering guides were prioritized.
- Security and governance priorities took precedence over performance optimizations, in line with the given priority order.
- Recommendations clearly emphasize separating concerns and improving testability while embedding security and compliance controls supported by recognized authoritative frameworks.
- No invented sources were introduced; all validation references correspond to recognized industry standards and widely accepted best practices.
- The final document is structured to align explicitly with the requested categories and professional audience expectations.

# 0001 – Record Architecture Decisions

*Status:* Accepted

## Context

The platform spans ingestion, processing, and governance. Without an explicit decision log, rationale is lost and architectural consistency erodes over time.

## Decision

We will document architecture decisions as ADRs using a consistent format (Context, Decision, Consequences) and maintain an index.

## Rationale

* **Transparency:** Decisions and trade-offs are visible to current and future contributors.
* **Risk control:** Revisiting past choices becomes feasible when requirements change.
* **Continuity:** Knowledge persists beyond individual team members.

## Consequences

* Small, ongoing documentation effort per decision.
* Faster onboarding and more consistent future design discussions.

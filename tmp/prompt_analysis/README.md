# Prompt Analysis Outputs (Non-Versioned)

This directory stores local outputs from agentic prompt runs.

- Outputs are **not** source of truth and should not be committed.
- Use for transient analysis, draft artifacts, or LLM run traces.
- If an output must be preserved, extract the relevant insight into documentation or code.

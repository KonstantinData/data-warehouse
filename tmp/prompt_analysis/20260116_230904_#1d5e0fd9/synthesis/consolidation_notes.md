# Consolidation Notes

- Inputs from the three specialist agents (code quality, architecture, and security) were deduplicated and synthesized to produce focused findings and recommendations without overlap.
- Security and governance concerns were prioritized and integrated throughout recommendations, as per conflict resolution priorities.
- Architectural insights such as repo structure assumptions and import side effects were merged with operational risks and maintainability considerations.
- Code quality agent’s observations on simplicity and clarity were balanced against security agent’s warnings about fragile `sys.path` mutation.
- No invented sources used; validation sources cross-checked against commonly accepted industry standards and authoritative frameworks.
- Omitted beginner-level details; emphasized explicit and precise language suitable for senior engineers, architects, and auditors.
- Recommendations distinctly identify how to improve robustness, observability, security, and documentation with a focus on long-term maintainability and compliance.
- The final output is concise yet comprehensive, suitable for inclusion in architecture decision records, security audits, or senior technical interviews.

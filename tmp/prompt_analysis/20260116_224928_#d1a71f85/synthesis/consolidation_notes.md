# Consolidation Notes

- Synthesized overlapping findings on correctness, readability, modularity, and error handling from code_quality_and_maintainability and code_architecture_and_operations while emphasizing security from the security agent's detailed analysis.

- Resolved conflicting depth of logging observation by recommending transition from print to structured logging to satisfy both maintainability and observability needs.

- Merged security critiques, elevating governance, secrets management, and data privacy into prioritized recommendations aligned with SSDF and OWASP standards.

- Excluded beginner-level comments and superficial code style remarks in favor of architecture-level concerns given the senior target audience.

- Cross-referenced each principle with authoritative external sources to ground recommendations and ensure defensible validation.

- Avoided duplications by grouping related findings under principle headings and unifying risks and mitigations thematically.

- Preserved clarity and precision, framing risks and mitigations in professional terminology suitable for architecture reviews and audits.

# Consolidation Notes

- The three agent reports exhibited strong overlap and complementarity on correctness, architecture, observability, security, and documentation.
- Redundant points across agents were consolidated into concise, coherent thematic sections.
- Security and governance findings integrated prioritized recommendations from security/compliance agent, favored authoritative OWASP and ISO references.
- Observability and failure handling conformed to Google SRE and CNCF SIG best practices as the authoritative operational guidance.
- Code quality and maintainability aspects were merged with architectural separation for clarity, highlighting modularity and testing.
- Recommendations avoid generic or beginner advice, reflect mature SSDF principles, and incorporate explicit risk mitigation strategies.
- Sources included only well-known frameworks, books, and standards explicitly referenced by agents or recognized as authoritative.
- No invented sources or unverifiable claims included; all points trace to industry standards or foundational literature.
- Minor omissions (e.g., explicit discussion of data lineage tools) were intentionally excluded due to lack of direct evidence and to maintain focus.
- Overall structure balances detail for senior engineers and architects without diluting critical security and operational considerations.

# Consolidation Notes

- The input agent reports were aligned with minimal conflict, reinforcing each other to cover all requested aspects—code quality, architecture, and security.
- All agents stressed the deterministic, modular nature and the lack of elaborate failure handling and observability in the current implementation.
- Security governance concerns primarily around secret management and data governance risks from external LLM calls were consolidated and emphasized.
- Recommendations merged safety, operational, and maintainability improvements, prioritizing secure software development lifecycle (SSDL) and SRE principles.
- Authoritative external sources were selected based on explicit references or relevance cited across reports, ensuring no invented or non-credible sources.
- Conflicts regarding depth of input validation and observability details were resolved by referencing established frameworks (OWASP, Google SRE).
- Documentation and ADR deficits were commonly noted; hence inclusion of architectural decision records as a best practice.
- Performance was unanimously considered a lower priority contextual factor, hence stated accordingly.
- Omissions: No trivial or beginner advice included; focus remains firmly on senior-level production-grade engineering insights.

# Consolidation Notes

- Synthesized three agent inputs into a structured, senior-level summary focused on production-grade Python data engineering pipelines.
- Deduplicated overlapping points on correctness, modularity, observability, and security; combined complementary insights on robustness, governance, and documentation.
- Resolved conflict on exception handling by emphasizing current partial support with a recommendation for comprehensive coverage aligned with SRE.
- Elevated security and governance considerations as highest priority per given guidance, integrating recommendations on secrets management, PII controls, and dependency scanning per industry frameworks.
- Incorporated architectural and operational recommendations to address observability gaps and testability needs without diluting focus on key practices.
- Culled trivial or beginner-level advice, ensuring language and focus suit senior engineers, architects, and recruiters.
- Validated all cited sources as reputable, publicly available, and authoritative in industry standards.
- Structured output into clear Findings, Risks, Recommendations, and Validation Sources for ease of consumption during architecture reviews or audits.
